## Abstract
**Background and objective**: Facial cues and expressions constitute a component of bodily responses that provide useful information
about one’s stress levels. They can be modelled consistently in terms of fundamental facial muscle movements, called facial Action
Units (AUs) according to the Facial Action Coding System. This article investigates automatic stress recognition based on AUs
with conventional Machine and Deep Learning techniques.


**Methods**: We created a new experimental dataset containing 58 participants performing 4 experimental phases and 11 stress and
non-stress tasks in which the proposed system performs automatic facial AUs recognition. A computational feature selection
method was employed to select a robust relevant features’ subset, which integrated with conventional Machine Learning and Deep
Learning using the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation algorithm methods to assess and model the implication of AUs under stress
conditions. Ordinal modelling was used following the pairwise transformation to establish a common reference based on the
personalized values of each participant.


**Results**: The results indicate that, under stress conditions, participants’ faces presented significantly more AUs and with greater
intense compared to neutral conditions. However, each stressor was manifested in different distinctive AUs. The mean yielded
classification accuracy of stress condition versus neutral achieved across all experimental tasks was greater than 93.22%. The
sensitivity and specificity were greater than 93.13%.


**Conclusions**: We identified AUs combinations which are relevant to the stress conditions of each experimental phase and potentially
utilized for each stressor type.

## Experimental Tasks
An experimental protocol was designed and conducted to investigate facial/physiological responses in stress conditions. The experiment included neutral tasks (used as reference) and stressful tasks in which stress conditions were simulated and induced employing different types of stressors. These stressors were categorized into 4 different phases: 
*	social exposure
*	emotional recall
*	mental workload tasks
*	stressful videos presentation

## Dataset population
The dataset population was 58 adults (24 men, 34 women) aged 26.9 ± 4.8 years. For each participant, 11 tasks were performed, among they were 
*	4 neutral 
*	6 stressed 
*	1 relaxed 

A neutral condition was presented at the beginning of each phase of the experiment. This condition was used as a baseline for the subsequent stressful tasks. 

##  Release of FORTH Stress dataset
The FORTH Stress dataset can be obtained and used by researchers who wish to perform non-comercial research. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of FORTH (approval no. 155/12-09-2022). All participants provided informed consent.

The FORTH Stress dataset has been freely available for research and education purposes. To obtain access to the dataset, you need to complete and sign the user agreement form (TBA in this repository). 
The form should be signed, and emailed to Giorgos Giannakakis  (ggian@ics.forth.gr). We will verify your request and contact you on how to download the dataset.
